# My Personal Website 
Abdan Hafidz, Glad To See You!

For more or less 3 years I have explored my coding skills to the end to pursue website development and the last 2 years I have worked in several institutions in the section of website development, IT division, full-stack development. And since I was in high school, I began to deepen my abilities in the field of computer science, until in the end I often won several National level competitions in the field of computer science or better known as Informatics in my country. I often have fun on the competitive programming platforms codeforces, atcoder, TLX, Vjduges and others. Not infrequently I also take part in National competitions with competitive programming categories and website design :) I do social media content creating too.
